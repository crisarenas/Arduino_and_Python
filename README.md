## Explanation:
The ultrasonic sensor is constantly reading the distance from any object to the sensor. When the distance is around 50 cm, it is configured to play or pause a video or song. Also, this code allows to turn the volume up or down.

It is possible to make other configurations to the sensor or even a sensor for each hand.

## Hardware:
* Arduino UNO/MEGA
* Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 
* Cables

## Software:
* Arduino IDE
* Python
